So I think what I need to do is:
Go to the main general conference page: lds.org/general-conference/conferences/?lang=eng
tell it to use the urls for each conference (iterate through) and within each one:
	Use each conference talk url(I think that it can be properly identified, although it might not be pretty. Depends)
		Within that, pull each talk.
    
This gets me back to 1971, which is good enough to start with. 

I still need to figure out how I want to capture the speaker, title, speaker title, byline, date, session, anything else? 
Where do I store this data? probably not on my laptop. At least, not for long.
