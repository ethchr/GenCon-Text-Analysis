Things I want to study
**First things first**
How often is Jesus Christ mentioned? 
What are the trends in using titles of Christ over the years?
are there trends in the testimonies at the end of each talk?

**Medium level**
Passive voice use differences between Genders
Does the last talk of a given GA differ from previous talks that GA has given? 
Is there anything in a 70 sermon that helps predict that they will one day become an Apostle?
Which scriptures do they quote? - I may need to create a corpora of the scriptures and remove direct quotations, try to fuzzy match paraphrases?
  *if gendered passive voice exists, is it due to quoting passive voice verses?

**Expert Level** 
Map pedogogical techniques. Homilies, Personal stories, stories of other members (Elder Neilson always shares stories from YW for some reason), paraboles, etc.
Map out trends with networks. do GAs that work together in Area presidencies or as missionaries back in the day, (other?) talk on the same subjects? I doubt I can get enough information here, but maybe.
