## Intro
Here are a few other ideas that I am thinking about. All of them so far are related to LDS topics, which is sort of problematic since that's not why I'm in graduate school. But they would all give me good tech experience, and maybe I can come up with some parallels that are more in my field.

### General Conference Tweets
Look at how people tweet about general conference. Things that would be interesting here would include:
*Other hashtags
*Do people invite over Twitter?
*Who uses the hashtags?
*do protesters tweet about it?
*Can I identify non-Mormons who tweet about Conference?

### Unit geographies
Ideally, I'd find a way to pull all of the meetinghouses and unit boundaries and look at things like average unit size, location of chapel within unit, how many units per building, etc. The only problem is I'm not sure there's an API to let me pull all that data, so this might not be possible. Okay, maybe it is, but it wouldn't be pleasant. Lots of "move .2 to right, click, collect resulting list of units." Maybe just do simple maps about temples and stuff?

### Temple Roadtrip
In the vein of that map showing the optimized roadtrip to hit all 50 states, a map to optimize hitting all Utah temples. The most impressive version of this would be to run it to figure out not just seeing the temple, but matching on session times to maximize the number of temples you could actively visit per day (since this would vary depending on which temple you started at). This would be Google Maps API + scraping session times (which is easy) + training an algorithm or something (much harder?)

### Network Analysis
Map out networks within Mormon twitterdom/blogdom/others?
